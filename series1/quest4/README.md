Multisig can be a little tricky to wrap your mind around at first, but it's an important and essential security feature of Stellar baked into the core of the protocol.

\*HINT: when adding multisig use `setOptions` but only set `Signer Type`. Do not touch `Master Weight` or any `Threshold` settings unless you're sure you know what you're doing.
