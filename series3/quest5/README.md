# Successfully submit a clawback operation
While currently a testnet only feature, the asset clawback operation will be a regulated asset issuer's excalibur of conquest in this brave new world of old â†’ new finance.

It's the Ctrl+Z for blockchain payments. The mechanic for undoing mistaken or fraudulent payments. Once an issuer and trustline have been created under the asset clawback umbrella, the issuer has the power to "clawback" any amount of that asset back into the issuing account, effectiveky burning it from existence.

Arguably a controversial feature, however, it's an absolute requirement for issuing regulated assets on the blockchain and ultimately it's issuer specific, so effectively the feature is opt-in and obvious from a consumer's perspective.
