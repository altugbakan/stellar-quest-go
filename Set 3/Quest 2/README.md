# Submit a transaction containing 100 operations
Stellar, like all good software, has lots of different caps, limits, and ceilings. For instance the cap on the number of operations per transaction is 100 at the moment.

Your challenge is to successfully orchestrate and submit a transaction stuffed full of 100 operations.

For the developers out there still clinging to the Laboratory, now might be a good time to flex your coding skills and utilize one of the Stellar [SDKs](https://github.com/stellar/go) inside a loop.
