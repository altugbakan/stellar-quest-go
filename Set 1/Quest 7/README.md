# Make use of a channel account to make a payment
In this challenge, your task is to submit a payment operation from your account, but to **use a seperate source account** to pay the fee and sequence number for the transaction.

This is known as a _fee channel_ or a _channel account._ It's a great way to soak up fees for users in larger apps or achieve higher transaction throughput.
