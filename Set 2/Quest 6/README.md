# Sponsor the absolute minimum balance for a new account
Storing stateful data on the Stellar blockchain isn't free. Everything from data attributes, trustlines and offers all the way down to just creating an account all increase the [minimum balance](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/minimum-balance/) of the account in question.

Up until protocol 15 this minimum balance had to be paid for by the account itself which often makes sense. However there are instances where it would be more convenient or even essential for these fees to be staked by some other account, a "sponsor" account.

In this challenge your task is to **create a brand new 0 XLM balance account with the absolute minimum balance sponsored by your account.**
