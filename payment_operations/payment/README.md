# Payment

### Send an amount of a specific asset to a destination account

The current primary use case of blockchain technology is to secure the transfer of valuable things. And Stellar is no exception.

**In this quest, your challenge is to perform a `payment` operation where you’ll submit a transaction containing that `payment` operation on the Stellar test network from the Quest Account to another account.**

So let’s get to it.

1. Navigate to the [Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/)
2. Go to the Build Transaction tab
3. Fill out the necessary fields and select Payment as the Operation Type, let’s talk about what we see here

#### Destination

Who’s the lucky recipient of the `payment` operation?

#### Asset

What asset you’d like to send. Assets on Stellar can represent many things: digital currencies (such as bitcoin), fiat currencies (USDC), or other tokens of value (such as NFTs).

For this quest, we’ll use the native XLM token and cover custom assets later.

#### Amount

How much of the asset you’re going to send. Remember you can only send what you have.

#### Source Account

What account will the network be subtracting funds from? Remember you can leave this blank and it will assume the transaction source.

4. Once you have the necessary fields completed, sign the transaction
5. Once the transaction is signed, go ahead and submit it
6. If the transaction was successful, fantastic! Go ahead and Verify it on the Stellar Quest Learn page and claim your new badge.
