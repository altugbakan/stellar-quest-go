# Create Account
### Create an account on the Stellar network
<br>
If Stellar were a universe, and it is, accounts would be the planets, stars, moons, and asteroids within that fertile space.

Less abstractly, accounts are the central data structure in Stellar — they hold balances, sign transactions, and issue assets. Accounts can only exist with a valid keypair and the required minimum balance of lumens (XLM).

**In this quest, your challenge is to perform a `createAccount` operation using the Quest Keypair located in the box on the right-hand side of this screen.**

This quest has two components:

1. Create the Quest Account by funding the Quest Keypair with XLM from friendbot
2. Create a new account using the `createAccount` operation with the Quest Account as the source account

So let’s get started!
