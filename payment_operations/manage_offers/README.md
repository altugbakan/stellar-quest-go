# Manage Offers
### Create an offer to buy or sell a specific asset for another
<br>
Now that we know how to trust and issue assets other than the native XLM token, we have what we need to begin utilizing Stellar’s native decentralized exchange or DEX. Manage offer operations allow you to offer to buy or sell a specific amount of an asset at a specific exchange rate for a different asset. For example, sell 14 of asset A for 64 of asset B.

Stellar has three operations that manage these exchange offers:
- Manage buy offer
- Manage sell offer
- Create passive sell offer

**In this quest, your challenge is to open a buy or sell offer on the Quest Account using the `manageBuyOffer`, `manageSellOffer` or `createPassiveSellOffer` operation.**

Let’s walk through the three manage offer operations in the [Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/)

1. Navigate to the Build Transaction tab, fill out the necessary fields, and select Manage Buy Offer, Manage Sell Offer or Create Passive Sell Offer for the Operation Type. Let’s talk about what each of these fields means.
