# Submit a pre-authorized transaction
So you probably saw this one coming considering the previous quest, but this challenge is to add as a signer then submit to the network, a pre-authorized transaction. The last of the signer types accepted for submitting transactions to the network.

Pre-authorized transactions are a fantastic way to get around the somewhat cumbersome issue of multisig coordination. Just add a transaction hash as a signer to your account and then pass along that XDR to any other signers for additional signing or final submission.

Simple, yet smart! A Simart Contractâ„¢! And just another great tool in your ever expanding tool belt of experience as a Stellar developer.
