# Use SEP-0006 to acquire some MULT from testanchor.stellar.org
Now that we've got ***SEP-0010*** under our belt, let's make use of it to make an automated testnet ***SEP-0006*** deposit to SDF's testanchor endpoint.

Between ***SEP-0006***, ***SEP-0024*** and ***SEP-0031*** we have all we need to connect Stellar with all the real world's "anchored" assets. ***SEP-0006*** is the API-only method for handling the flow so let's try that.

Your task today will be to use ***SEP-0006*** to request a deposit of ***MULT*** issued by ***GDLD3SOLYJTBEAK5IU4LDS44UMBND262IXPJB3LDHXOZ3S2QQRD5FSMM*** from the testanchor.stellar.org endpoint.

This task will actually make use of ***SEP-0010***, ***SEP-0006*** and ***SEP-0012*** so buckle up, read the docs, and enjoy the ride!

Finally I'm sure you're noticing by now we've begun to drift away from the Laboratory harbor into the more adventurous waters of the greater world wide web.

For Quests like this if you're uncomfortable whipping up some new code feel free to use ***curl*** or a tool like www.postman.com for constructing your non-Laboratory API calls.
