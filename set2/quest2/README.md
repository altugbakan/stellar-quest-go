# Construct and execute a multi-operational transaction
Did you know each Stellar transaction can include as many as 100 unique operations? ðŸ˜± This is an incredible feature as each transaction is atomic meaning either the whole group of operations succeed or fail together.

In this challenge your task is to create a multi-operational transaction which creates a custom asset trustline on your account and pays that asset to your account from the issuing account all in the same transaction.

**Fun fact:** This is actually what is done at Stellar Quest when issuing prizes. The claim transaction is a nice little multi-operational transaction adding and issuing the badge to your account all in a single transaction.
